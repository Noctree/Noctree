Hi, I'm Noctre.
A mediocre programmer focusing mainly on C#.
I've been working for several years in the Unity game engine, but have switched recently to the Godot engine.
Currently have a junior position in a small company, but I still program in my free time just for fun.
Would like to get into making games, but I'm not too good with realising ideas :/
